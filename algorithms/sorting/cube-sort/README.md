# Cube Sort

Cube sort is a parallel sorting algorithm that builds a self-balancing multi-dimensional array from the keys to be sorted. As the axes are of similar length the structure resembles a cube. After each key is inserted the cube can be rapidly converted to an array.

Time complexity

| Best     |  Average      | Worst       |
| -------- | --------      | ------      |
| Ω(n)     |  Θ(n log(n))  | O(n log(n)) |

Space Complexity

|        Worst        |
|---------------------|
|        O(n)         |
