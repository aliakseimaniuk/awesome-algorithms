# Cocktail Shaker Sort

Cocktail shaker sort, also known as **bidirectional bubble sort**, **cocktail sort**, **shaker sort** (which can also refer to a variant of selection sort), **ripple sort**, **shuffle sort**, or **shuttle sort**, is a variation of bubble sort that is both a stable sorting algorithm and a comparison sort. The algorithm differs from a bubble sort in that it sorts in both directions on each pass through the list. This sorting algorithm is only marginally more difficult to implement than a bubble sort, and solves the problem of turtles in bubble sorts. It provides only marginal performance improvements, and does not improve asymptotic performance; like the bubble sort, it is not of practical interest (insertion sort is preferred for simple sorts), though it finds some use in education.
