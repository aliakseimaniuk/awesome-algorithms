# Quicksort

Quicksort (sometimes called partition-exchange sort) is an efficient sorting algorithm, serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of an array in order. Developed by Tony Hoare in 195 and published in 1961, it is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. When implemented well, it can be about two or three times faster than its main competitors, merge sort and heapsort.

Time complexity

| Best         |  Average     | Worst  |
| ----         | --------     | ------ |
| Ω(n log(n))  |  Θ(n log(n)) | O(n^2) |

Space Complexity
